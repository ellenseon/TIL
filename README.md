# 🌿 Ellen’s TIL (Today I Learned)

Welcome to my **Today I Learned (TIL)** repository —  
a daily record of my progress across technology, creativity, and personal growth.

## 🧭 Focus Areas

- **🎓 Technical Education** — Designing and recording AWS / Cloud Computing lectures.  
- **🚀 Startup** — Building *VibeDive*, an AI-based CBT self-care MVP.  
- **📈 Investment** — Practicing data-driven, company-based investment analysis.  
- **🎹 Music** — Jazz harmony, composition, and emotional instrumental production.  
- **💪 Lifestyle & Balance** — Strength, mindfulness, and minimalist living.

## ✏️ Purpose

> “Learning fades if not recorded.  
> Writing transforms it into growth.”

I maintain this TIL to:
- Track and systematize learning across disciplines.  
- Convert small daily progress into long-term consistency.  
- Reflect on what’s working — and what’s not.

Each log entry represents an iteration, not perfection.

## 🗂 Writing Format

Every TIL entry follows this structure:

1. **Today’s Work**  
2. **What I Learned / Reflections**  
3. **Proud Moments**  
4. **Tasks Missed & Why**  
5. **Balance Check**  
6. **Tomorrow’s Focus**  
7. **One-line Reflection**

## 💡 Core Philosophy

> “Consistency beats intensity.”  
> Through daily reflection, I aim to grow deliberately —  
> balancing logic, emotion, and execution.
